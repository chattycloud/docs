## Chatty Component

Let's assume that user want to chat with touching chat icon button at other person's profile screen.

If init function is completed with success each other, both of them are ready to join chat.

Then as below, navigate to following Chat.js screen with 'with' param that indicates peer member id.

This example javascript with react

```javascript
// Chat.js file that you generated

import Chatty from 'chatty-cloud-js';

const Chat = (props) => {
  return (
    <Chatty
      with={props.route.params.with}                          // assign peer member id which want to chat with to 'with' param
      headerLeftOnPress={() => props.navigation.goBack()}     // register callback function for returning back to previous screen 
    />
  );
};

export default Chat;


```
