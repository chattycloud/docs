## What for initialize

To use sdk properly, need to initialize two things as below

- API key generated at dashboard
- Register user's id and name as a member to let sdk know who attend chat


## Where to initialize
- Place where can specify the user identification during application booting up
- And after member signin or login


<InfoBlock type="note">
- Even if init function is called multiple time, the member is not registered as a duplicate (member is always unique)
- If member signout and signin again, the member id should be different with previous member id. especially, in case of third party oauth login, don't use provider's id as member id
</InfoBlock>



file: App.js
```javascript
import Chatty from 'chatty-cloud';


// When identifier of user is specific, call init function
// Ex) 1. during application bootup process, 2. after new user join or login

if (isLoggedIn) {
  await Chatty.init({
    apiKey: <API KEY>,                // API Key of your app that created in dashboard 
    member: {
      id: <MEMBER ID>,                // mandatory  (ex: user.id)
      name: <MEMBER NAME>,            // mandatory  (ex: user.name)
      avatar: <MEMBER AVATAR URL>,    // optional   (ex: user.avatar)
      language: <MEMBER LANGUAGE>,    // optional   (ex: 'en')
      country: <MEMBER COUNTRY>,      // optional   (ex: 'US')
      deviceToken: <FCM DEVICE TOKEN> // optional   
    }
  });
}
```
