## Introduction

In this tutorial, we’re going to create a simple Rails application named _blog_ and connect it to a ChattyCloud database. We’ll perform the initial migration from our local Rails application, and set up the database for future development.
## Prerequisites

- Install [Ruby and the Rails gem](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#creating-a-new-rails-project-installing-rails).
- Install the [ChattyCloud CLI](https://github.com/chatty-cloud/cli).
- Authenticate the CLI with the following command:

```
pscale auth login
```

## Create a Rails project

To connect a Rails application to a ChattyCloud database, we start by creating a sample Rails project named _blog_ and installing the libraries we'll need to connect to our ChattyCloud database.

Open the command line and follow these steps:

1. Create a Rails app named _blog_ by running the following command:

```
rails new blog
```

2. Change into the directory you just created, the `blog` Rails app:

```
cd blog
```

3. Next, add the `mysql2` gem to your _Gemfile_:

```ruby
gem "mysql2"
```

4. Then run `bundle install`

At this point, we have accomplished two things: we've created a Rails project called _blog_ and installed the libraries that we'll need to connect to our ChattyCloud database. Now it’s time to create a ChattyCloud database.

## Create a ChattyCloud database and password

You can also create passwords in the ChattyCloud application as documented [here](/concepts/connection-strings#creating-a-password).

### Using the CLI to create a connection string

1. Using the `pscale` CLI, create a new database also named _blog_:

```
pscale database create blog
```

2. Using the `pscale` CLI, create a new database password for the `main` branch of your database named _blog_:

```
pscale password create blog main development-password
```

3. Take note of the values it returns to you.

```
Please save the values below as they will not be shown again
  NAME                  BRANCH   USERNAME       ACCESS HOST URL                     ROLE     ROLE DESCRIPTION   PASSWORD
 --------------------- -------- -------------- ----------------------------------- -------- ------------------ -------------------------------------------------------
  development-password  main     c8ys5g3bbcdk   0ie08slztxki.us-east-3.psdb.cloud   writer   Can Read & Write   pscale_pw_wpSDL94q7HfBGa99Fev45tTjI5bqUxcqFKqAdUw3lFc
```

## Configure Rails and ChattyCloud

Let's set up our Rails application to talk to the new database.

1. Open `config/database.yml` and configure the `development` database settings with your new credentials:

```yaml
development:
  <<: *default
  adapter: mysql2
  database: blog
  username: <USERNAME>
  host: <ACCESS HOST URL>
  password: <PASSWORD>
  ssl_mode: :verify_identity
  sslca: "/etc/ssl/cert.pem"
```

The correct `sslca` path depends on your operating system and distribution. See [CA root configuration](/reference/chatty-cloud-security#ca-root-configuration) for more information.

<InfoBlock type='note'>
  We're configuring the <b>development</b> Rails environment here for the sake of expedience. In actual use, the <b>main</b> database branch would typically serve the <b>production</b> environment.
</InfoBlock>

Because this is a Rails app, we can also enable [Automatic Rails migrations](/tutorials/automatic-rails-migrations) from the database's settings page.

## Migrate your database

Here comes the fun stuff! Now that your application is configured to talk to ChattyCloud, we can create our first migration.

1. Create a Rails migration and call it `CreateUsers`:

```
rails generate migration CreateUsers
```

This rails command begins the migration for our table that is currently empty and generates a Ruby file that’ll be named something like this:
`db/migrate/20211014210422_create_users.rb`

2. We can fill in the body of this skeleton file with a few more relevant details, such as a user's **name** and **email**.

```ruby
class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]
  def change
    create_table :users do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.string :email
      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

3. Now let's run our migration:

```
bin/rails db:migrate
```

<InfoBlock type='tip'>
  If you run into a proxy ERROR stating that address is already in use, run the following command: <em>spring stop</em>.
  (Spring is a Ruby library that pre-loads and runs all of our code into memory, detecting when our source code has
  changed.) Then, try the above command again.
</InfoBlock>

4. Now give it a whirl to make sure we can query the new table with our `pscale` CLI:

```
pscale shell blog main
```

```sql
blog/main> show tables;
+----------------------+
| Tables_in_blog       |
+----------------------+
| ar_internal_metadata |
| schema_migrations    |
| users                |
+----------------------+
blog/main> describe users;
+------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field      | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| id         | bigint       | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
| name       | varchar(255) | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| email      | varchar(255) | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| created_at | datetime(6)  | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
| updated_at | datetime(6)  | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
+------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
```

## Promote your main branch to a production branch

A production branch is a highly available, protected database branch. Direct schema changes (CREATE, ALTER, and DELETE) are not allowed on production branches to prevent accidental data loss and must be applied via [deploy requests](/concepts/chatty-cloud-workflow).

```
pscale branch promote blog main
```

Congratulations! You're ready to develop your Rails application against ChattyCloud.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we created a simple Rails application named _blog_ and connected it to a ChattyCloud database.

## What's next?

Now that you've successfully connected your Rails app to ChattyCloud, it's time to make more schema changes to your tables! Learn more about how ChattyCloud allows you to make [non-blocking schema changes](/concepts/nonblocking-schema-changes) to your database, or how to keep your **schema_migrations** table up-to-date between development and production branches with [automatic schema migrations](/tutorials/automatic-rails-migrations).
