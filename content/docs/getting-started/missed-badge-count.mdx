## GitHub Secret Scanning integration

All passwords and service tokens generated for use with ChattyCloud databases are part of GitHub's [Secret Scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-security/about-secret-scanning) program. If any database passwords or service tokens are committed in plain text to any public GitHub repository, we will be notified and take corrective action to delete the access tokens and cut off their access.
