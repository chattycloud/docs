At ChattyCloud, we are committed to delivering a powerful and easy-to-use database platform, while keeping your data secure. We take security very seriously and we are working hard to constantly improve our security solutions, to build security into every layer of our products, and to ensure the continuous security and integrity of data stored on our platform.

## Compliance Certification

ChattyCloud is certified to a System and Organization Controls(SOC) Type 2. To receive a copy of the report please [contact Support](https://www.chatty-cloud.com/support).

## Application Security

### Encryption of data

ChattyCloud databases and their client communications are AES-256bit encrypted throughout the ChattyCloud platform both in transit and at rest.

#### At rest

Data is encrypted at rest on the underlying storage media that serves database branches and also the underlying storage media that hosts ChattyCloud's database backups. This helps mitigate the risk of unintentional or malicious access to user data on storage systems.

#### In transit

Encrypted data is transmitted to ChattyCloud databases through two major paths:
 - The [ChattyCloud CLI](/reference/chatty-cloud-cli), leverages [Mutual TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication#mTLS) when initiating a connection to ChattyCloud via `shell` or `connect` commands.
 - ChattyCloud [Connection Strings](/concepts/connection-strings) require the successful establishment of a TLS session before any SQL commands can be issued.

### Additional data protection controls

Communications to the ChattyCloud API and Dashboard are encrypted using TLS 1.3;
leveraging certificates from an established third party certificate authority.

## Corporate Security

### Security Training

During onboarding (within 30 days of their hire date) and annually thereafter, all ChattyCloud team members
complete security awareness training covering company security policies and procedures. The
training courses are designed to assist the trainee in identifying and responding to social
engineering attacks and avoid inappropriate security practices.

### Device Protection

All company-provided devices are managed with [SimpleMDM](https://simplemdm.com/), enforcing full-disk encryption and the continuous running of antivirus software.

### Background Checks

Background checks are performed on new team members during onboarding (within 60 days of their hire date)
as permitted by local law.
