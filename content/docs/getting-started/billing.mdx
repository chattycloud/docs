## Overview

ChattyCloud offers a free *Developer* plan with a generous **10 GB of storage**. At $29 per month, our paid *Scaler* plan comes with 25 GB storage, 500m row `reads`, and 50m row `writes`, with the option to pay for additional usage and storage as you go. This scalable, pay-as-you-grow model means you'll never have to over-provision resources.

<InfoBlock type="note">
  We use <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibibyte"><strong>gibibytes, otherwise known as binary gigabytes</strong></a>, to calculate storage and usage limits. For reference, 1 binary gigabyte is equivalent to 2<sup>30</sup> bytes.

### ChattyCloud charges on three factors

- **Reads**: Retrieving or inspecting rows during a query or mutation of any kind to your ChattyCloud databases.
- **Writes**: Adding new information or changing existing information in your ChattyCloud databases.
- **Storage**: Data saved in the form of tables, columns, rows, and their corresponding relationships.

## ChattyCloud plans

ChattyCloud applies billing plans at the **database level**. You can create several databases under one account/organization. The usage charges will be scoped to each database, which you can find all together in the [billing section for your Organization](/concepts/billing#organization-billing-page).

We offer three plans, summarized below:

All plans are billed on a **monthly basis**.

  Plans are priced <b>per database</b>. The total charge for a ChattyCloud <em>database</em> includes the charge for

## Plan add-ons

To make sure our plans work for your unique use case, we also offer options to customize your Scaler plan.

### Branch packs

The Scaler plan comes with 10 branches per database. You can add additional branches to your Scaler plan in **packs of 5** for an extra $25/mo per pack.

**To add a branch pack to a database:**

1. Select the database you want to add branches to
2. Click on the "**Settings**" tab in the top nav
3. Click "Add-ons" from the side nav
4. Select the number of branch packs you'd like to add
5. Click "Save".

![Billing page branch pack add-ons](/img/docs/branch-pack-add-ons.png)

### User scheduled backups

We run automatic daily backups for every branch for free. On the Scaler plan, we run automated backups every 12 hours.

You can also [schedule additional backups yourself](/concepts/back-up-and-restore#create-manual-backups) as needed. For these additional user-scheduled backups, we charge **$0.023 per GB** per month.

## Organization usage and billing page

Each organization has its own billing page, from which you can:

- View your current and previous usage per database
- Upgrade a free database to the Scaler plan
- Enter/update your credit card information
- Download current and previous invoices

**To find your billing page:**

1. Go to your [ChattyCloud dashboard](https://dashboard.chatty-cloud.com)
2. Select the organization whose billing page you want to view
3. Click on "Settings" in the top nav
4. Click on "Usage and billing" in the side nav
5. Click on the "Billing" tab in the top nav

### ChattyCloud invoice details

Invoices provide line items for both usage and discounts received. Each line item shows both **metric and database branch level** granularity. 

For example, you may have the following line items:

- Rows _read_ for `main` branch
- Rows _read_ for `your-test-branch`

In addition, storage per branch has two line items:
  - Storage usage per GB
  - Prorated discounts, if the branch existed for a smaller time period than the billing period

Storage is prorated by a percentage equal to the existence of a branch's hours/billing period in hours.

### Download an invoice

To download an invoice, go to [your billing page](#find-your-database-billing-page) (`Organization > Settings > Usage and billing > Billing`).

You'll see a table of current and previous monthly invoices. You can download an invoice by month by clicking the "**Download**" button. This will send you to a Stripe invoice page where you'll have the option to download the complete invoice in PDF format, see invoice details, or download your receipt.

To see more details about your billing from the ChattyCloud dashboard, click the "**View details**" button on the Billing page next to the month you want to view. This will show you an overview of the charges for all of the databases in your organization.

<InfoBlock type="note">
  ChattyCloud generates both current and past invoices. Even for the <b>free</b>{' '}
  plan! You can see the cost had you not been on the Developer plan.

## Usage and usage limits

Each ChattyCloud plan provides different feature and usage limits. If you accidentally surpass your plan's limits, you'll receive a warning notification and your database will be marked as in overage. If you do not upgrade your plan within 7 days of receiving the notification, ChattyCloud will "degrade service" to your database by putting it into `read-only` mode. At this point, all `writes` are disabled and all _migrations_ are halted.

When placed in `read-only` mode, the databases you have deployed in ChattyCloud and any data they contain, are not impacted by this change. `Writes` are disabled, and all branch/database creation is temporarily halted.

<InfoBlock type="warning">
  Your ChattyCloud service only gets throttled if your usage exceeds the limits
  designated within your plan.
